# Eclipse - A Bliss Edit

Bliss is already one of the best and most feature rich shaders out there, yet I still wanted more...  
It started out with smaller features, but then the additions just kept piling up.

Notable changes/additions compared to Bliss unstable:
 + Custom moon orbit with possible eclipses
 + Water wave simulation for the player
 + Shader Grass
 + Aurora & Rainbow
 + Handheld shadows
 + Additional cirrus & cumulonimbus cloud layers (WIP)
 + Distant Horizons chunk fading
 + Moon Texture with phases
 + Snow Overlay and Rain Ripples
 + Better mod support
 + Better shader-side (hardcoded) emissives
 + Lightsource with shadows on the main end island
 + Better lightning strikes with clouds lighting up and shadows
 + Voxy, Colorwheel, Caelum (Arda Craft) support
 + Emissive Ores

Note: With default settings there is at least one guaranteed eclipse per ingame year.

## Eclipses <sub>(why else would I call the shader Eclipse??)</sub>

# How to download the latest version:
 - locate the `green "code" button` on this page. this button is NOT in the `releases` page.
 - click the `green "code" button` and select `"download zip"`.
 - once the zip file finishes downloading, install it like a normal shader. you do NOT need to unzip/extract/decompress.

# You want MOAR performance?
 Delete the gbuffers_terrain.tcs and gbuffers_terrain.tes files for all world folders in the shaders.
 This will make the shader grass setting non functional BUT will increase performance, especially with high vanilla render distances!
 (If you're wondering why, Iris does NOT allow me to disable these files once they're there. So even when Shader Grass is disabled these execute and harm performance!)
